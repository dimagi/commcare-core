/**
 * A query handler encapsulates piece of code which can inspect predicates for shortcuts in how
 * to evaluate them, and provide an expectaiton of how efficient they will be in doing so, to
 * allow faster potential optimizations to be attempted before slower ones.
 *
 * Query Handlers are specific to a Model (like a StorageBackedTreeRoot) and their responses
 * are expected to be model id's of elements in that model. The integer model ID's are converted
 * to multiplicities by the root.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a query handler executes in order:
 * 1. [Potentially] Collect custom profiles from predicates unique to this handler
 * 2. Given collected profiles, identify whether this handler can match any of them
 * 3. Attempt a match
 * 4. Remove any matched predicates.
 *
 * 3 and 4 are split because there may be cases where #2 identifies a high likelihood of matching
 * a prediate, but a match turns out to not be possible. In those cases it's still important to be
 * able to fail to process the provided predicate query and keep it in the set to be handled by
 * another handler.
 *
 * Note: QueryHandler objects should not store any query specific state. Caches of data and other
 * results-specific information should be stored in QueryCache objects attached to the query context

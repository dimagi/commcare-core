/**
 * A ModelQuerySetMatcher identifies from a provided XPathExpression or TreeReference that the
 * expression/reference pattern is referring to a semantic concept that can be evaluated with
 * a query set lookup, and provides the relevant lookup object which can be used to potentially
 * match and perform that lookup.
 *
 * For Example:
 * in the caseb
 *
 * the predicate:
 * [@case_id = 'hardcoded']
 *
 * could be semantically encoded as a QuerySetLookup which returns a case's internal model id,
 * entirely bypassing the process of performing XPath Evalutions.
 *
 * Similarly, the predicate
 * [index/parent = current()/@case_id]
 *
 * could be interpreted semantically by knowing that current()/@case_id will be an ID that can
 * be matched to a set of cases's index/parent. A matcher could return a lookup which will take
 * in a context and identify the case to be matched and return the model ID of cases that index it
 * without having to have the engine perform that iteratively.
 *
 * //TODO: currently these matchers only have the ability to reason within the current model,
 * but we may need to reach between models to match complex query lookps
